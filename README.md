# Novella

Novella is a project I created with my team (from design to coding) in 2021 as our "Code For Palestine" graduation project. Novella solves the problems that faces most of the readers and creates a community of exchanging books and thoughts.

## Problem statement
Mostly readers prefer to physically hold the books but they are challenged by multiple factors, such as:
- Not being able to afford many books and having to only read books within the budget.
- Having a shelf full of books with no space for new ones.
- The unavailability of the book in the local libraries.

## What Novella provides for the readers:
1. A platform to login and sign up with your personal information and location.
2. The ability to publish your old book to lend for someone who needs it.
3. The ability to ask someone who had published their book to borrow their book.
4. The ability to exchange book with a different user.
5. Recommendation to books according to your preferences.
6. Adding wanted books to your wishlist.
7. Getting a notification when the wanted book is available for lending/exchange.

## Thing that are still in progress:
1. Filtering book.
2. Notifications.
3. Recommendations.
4. Enhancing user experience in managing requests for lending book.
5. Creating communities and chat functionality.
6. Add rating after dealing with a specific user.

## Technologies used:
1. React.js
2. Material UI
3. Mapbox
4. Firebase
